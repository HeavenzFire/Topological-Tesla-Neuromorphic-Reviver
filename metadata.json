  "name": "Topological Tesla Neuromorphic Reviver",
  "description": "A web interface to simulate the revival of neural patterns using a framework based on topological neuromorphic quantum states and Tesla's resonant energy principles. Input a neural spike pattern, initiate the revival process, and analyze the simulated results including fidelity, quantum state distribution, and an AI-generated technical analysis.",
